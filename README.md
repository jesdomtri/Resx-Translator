# Resx-Translator

This program translates resx files to a number of selected languages.
It's very simple to use, so I doubt that it requires instructions or screenshots explaining how it works

I don't know how to make Windows trust my application and I have not cared about it either. If you don't trust me, you can compile the source code with the following command:

    pyinstaller .\Translator.py -w --onefile --name Resx-Translator --icon=icon.ico --clean

To do this, you must install the PyInstaller module with pip like this: 

    pip install pyinstaller
